# # 18 My Social Network

## Description

This is my social network application where you can share your thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js to format timestamps. The seed data is created using Insomnia.
